    <li><strong>If your payment is in PENDING</strong> and is <span class="label label-success">{{config.PayoutThreshold}}</span> minimum, then your payment should be processed within <strong>{{config.PayoutInterval}}</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Before asking an admin</strong>, first click the Transaction ID associated with your payment. If it appears on the blockchain, the payment has been sent. You should thus check your wallet is synced, you have the right address, or ask your exchange where your payment is. If the payment is sent and appears on the blockchain it will <strong>NOT</strong> be re-sent. Only missing payments will be re-sent (missing payments are <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> rare as our payment system verifies transactions and re-sends as necessary). If your payment is missing on the blockchain, contact an admin via the About page.</li>
